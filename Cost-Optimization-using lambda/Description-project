Problem statement:- Delete all the EBS snapshot that are not used, or those snapshot that are not attached to volume, and 
                    that volumne is not attached to EC2 instance. 
Description:-
	The lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ‘self’ and also retrieves the active EC2 
  instances(running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume is not associated with 
  any active instance. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.

Steps:
1. Create a EC2 instance, wait till the instance state becomes running state, and status check -2/2 status check.
2. Scroll to the left panel, go on Elastic Block Storage -> click on snapshot -> create a snapshot.
    2.a Snapshot will be created of the volume attach to the EC2 instance.
3. Now, search lambda service and create lambda function.
4. In lambda function
    4.a Write the code logic to perform the operation.
    4.b Deploy the code.
    4.c then, Test the code 
    4.d You will get error while running the test, so add the permission to the role
5. Go to Configuration -> on the left side you see permission option -> click on link
6. You will redirect to the new tab
7. Add permission, like deleteSnapshot,  Describe snapshot to snapshot
8. Add permission to ec2 instance like DescribeVolume, DescribeInstances
9. Attach the customer managed policies to the role.
10. Return to the lambda tab.
10. Deploy and test the lambda.
11. Snapshot deleted successfully
